# Web-Based Turing Machine Simulator
This project is a web application akin to JFLAP. Users can input a Turing machine, represented as a graph, and simulate its execution on a string defined by the user.

## Setup and Building
To set up and build this project, download the source code and install the necessary node modules. Serve the directory using a tool like Python's SimpleHTTPServer, and then open the index.html file. It has been verified to work seamlessly in Chrome, though compatibility is expected in any browser supporting the canvas renderer.
